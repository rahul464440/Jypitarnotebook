## Arithmetic Expressions
In this section, we'll explore basic arithmetic expressions using Python.

# Multiplication and Addition
x = 5
y = 3
multiplication_result = x * y
addition_result = x + y
print("Multiplication:", multiplication_result)
print("Addition:", addition_result)
# Conversion: Minutes to Hours
minutes = 150
hours = minutes // 60
remaining_minutes = minutes % 60
print(minutes, "minutes is equal to", hours, "hours and", remaining_minutes, "minutes.")

## Objectives
In this notebook, we aim to:
- Explore various data science languages and libraries.
- Understand basic arithmetic operations in Python.
- Convert minutes into hours using Python code.
